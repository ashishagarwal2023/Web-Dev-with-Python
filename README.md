# What's this?
This is my book **Building Web Apps With Python**'s project files. Actually you need to do nothing out of these, I just want you to buy (or just check out) my new book.

It's about to be completed, and as soon as it is completed and published, I'll give you all here a small preview too. For the rest of time, view the book's cover (file ./Cover.png):
